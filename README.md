This application is a search engine for all things music.
Using the iTunes and IMVDb APIs, it displays a range of data about ther artists/albums/songs that you search for and links to listen to/download the music.

There are quite a few unresolved issues, they are:

- the music videos will not load as i do not have permissions
- the information that is provided is fairly scarce at the moment, and in the future will be linking more APIs to gather more information
- the Artist images are nothing to do with the artists themselves, which i will also fix with more time by writing a second fetch to the iTunes API
